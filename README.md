# Indian Currency Notes Classifier System for Visually Impaired

This project aims to provide a solution tailored for visually impaired individuals to identify Indian currency notes efficiently. Leveraging state-of-the-art technologies, we've developed a classifier system that utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques. 

**Python Libraries Utilized:**
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

By harnessing the power of these libraries, our system enables seamless currency recognition and audio feedback, empowering visually impaired users to independently differentiate between various Indian currency notes. 

Contributions and feedback are welcome! Let's make a positive impact together. ðŸŒŸ
